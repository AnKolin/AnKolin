- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnKolin and I have graduated Biotech from university with M.Sc.
My experience so far has been associated with laboratory work, customer service and sales.
However, I would like to start my adventure with data analysis, because I feel it can be very fascinating!
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced Excel, Power BI, VBA, SQL and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that will help me to develop (:
- 📫 How to reach me? Please write here or via e-mail (akolinska at hotmail domain).
